        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken biryani is a fragrant and flavorful South Asian rice dish made by layering aromatic basmati rice with tender, spiced chicken. The chicken is typically marinated in yogurt and a blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and chili powder, then slow-cooked with onions, tomatoes, and fresh herbs such as mint and cilantro. The rice is partially cooked before being combined with the chicken, allowing the flavors to meld together during the final steaming process. Saffron-infused milk or ghee is often drizzled over the layers, giving the dish its signature golden hue and rich aroma.</p>
        <p>This dish is cherished for its balance of textures and flavors — the fluffy, separate rice grains contrast beautifully with the juicy, spice-coated chicken pieces. Each bite carries a harmony of warmth from the spices, freshness from the herbs, and richness from the ghee. Chicken biryani is not only a festive centerpiece in many households but also a comfort food enjoyed casually, often accompanied by cooling raita, tangy pickles, or crisp papad. Its appeal lies in how it brings together culinary traditions, aromatic spices, and a sense of celebration in one satisfying, hearty meal.</p>

                    </ul>

            <li>Layer the biryani</li>
            <ol>
