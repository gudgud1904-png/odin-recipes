        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken is a beloved comfort food known for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and juicy, tender meat inside. Traditionally, chicken pieces are seasoned with a blend of spices, sometimes marinated in buttermilk for extra tenderness, then coated in flour or a breadcrumb mixture before being deep-fried until crunchy. The frying process seals in the juices while creating that satisfying, crunchy crust that makes fried chicken irresistible. Variations exist around the world, from the spicy crunch of Southern-style fried chicken to the lighter, seasoned batter of Korean fried chicken.</p>
        <p>What makes fried chicken special is its perfect balance of textures and flavors. Each bite delivers a contrast between the flavorful crust — seasoned with herbs, spices, and sometimes a hint of heat — and the moist, succulent chicken within. It’s often served hot with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, biscuits, or corn on the cob, making it a centerpiece of family meals, picnics, and gatherings. Its universal appeal has made it a culinary icon that transcends cultural boundaries, with countless regional interpretations that keep the dish fresh and exciting.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 kg chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, or a mix)</li>
                    <li>2 cups buttermilk (or plain yogurt thinned with water)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>

                    <li>1 tsp paprika or chili powder (optional for spice)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Mix well so all pieces are coated, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best for juiciness).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Prepare the coating</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In another bowl, mix:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tsp paprika or chili powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Take each marinated chicken piece, let the excess buttermilk drip off, and coat well in the flour mixture.</li>
                <li>Press the flour onto the chicken to form a thick crust.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Fry the chicken</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 175°C (350°F) — enough oil to submerge the pieces.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken in small batches for 12–15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through (internal temp should reach 75°C / 165°F).</li>
                <li>Drain on a wire rack or paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Let the chicken rest for a few minutes so the juices settle.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with coleslaw, fries, biscuits, or your favorite dipping sauces.</li>
