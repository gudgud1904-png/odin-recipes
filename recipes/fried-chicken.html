        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken is a beloved comfort food known for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and juicy, tender meat inside. Traditionally, chicken pieces are seasoned with a blend of spices, sometimes marinated in buttermilk for extra tenderness, then coated in flour or a breadcrumb mixture before being deep-fried until crunchy. The frying process seals in the juices while creating that satisfying, crunchy crust that makes fried chicken irresistible. Variations exist around the world, from the spicy crunch of Southern-style fried chicken to the lighter, seasoned batter of Korean fried chicken.</p>
        <p>What makes fried chicken special is its perfect balance of textures and flavors. Each bite delivers a contrast between the flavorful crust — seasoned with herbs, spices, and sometimes a hint of heat — and the moist, succulent chicken within. It’s often served hot with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, biscuits, or corn on the cob, making it a centerpiece of family meals, picnics, and gatherings. Its universal appeal has made it a culinary icon that transcends cultural boundaries, with countless regional interpretations that keep the dish fresh and exciting.</p>
