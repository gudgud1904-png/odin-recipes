        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French fries are a classic snack and side dish made from potatoes cut into sticks or wedges, then deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, with a soft and fluffy interior. While their exact origin is debated between France and Belgium, their worldwide popularity is undisputed. They can be seasoned simply with salt or dressed up with spices, cheese, or sauces, and are often served alongside burgers, fried chicken, or sandwiches. The key to perfect fries lies in using the right potato variety and cooking them in a way that ensures both crispness and flavor.</p>
        <p>French fries’ charm lies in their simplicity and versatility. Whether thin and crunchy like shoestring fries or thick and hearty like steak fries, they adapt to many tastes and cuisines. They’re enjoyed with condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, vinegar, or specialty sauces, and in some countries, they’re even topped with gravy or melted cheese, as in poutine. From fast-food chains to gourmet restaurants, French fries remain a universal favorite, offering the comfort of something familiar yet endlessly customizable to suit any craving.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>4–5 large potatoes (Russet or any starchy variety works best)</li>
                <li>1–2 liters vegetable oil (for deep-frying)</li>
                <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Optional Seasoning & extras</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
                <li>Paprika or chili powder (for a spicy touch)</li>
                <li>Garlic powder or onion powder (for extra flavor)</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley (finely chopped, for garnish)</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the potatoes</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and peel 4–5 large potatoes (Russet or any starchy type works best).</li>
                <li>Cut them into even sticks — about 1 cm thick for classic fries, thinner for shoestring style.</li>
                <li>Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes (this removes excess starch and helps make them crisp).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>First fry (blancing)</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with a clean towel.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep pan to about 150°C (300°F).</li>
                <li>Fry the potatoes in small batches for 3–4 minutes — they should soften but not brown.</li>
                <li>Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Second fry (crisping)</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Increase the oil temperature to 190°C (375°F).</li>
                <li>Fry the blanched potatoes again in small batches for 2–3 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Season and serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>While still hot, sprinkle with salt (and optional seasonings like black pepper, paprika, or garlic powder).</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with ketchup, mayonnaise, or your favorite dip.</li>
            </ol>
