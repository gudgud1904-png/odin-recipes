        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French fries are a classic snack and side dish made from potatoes cut into sticks or wedges, then deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, with a soft and fluffy interior. While their exact origin is debated between France and Belgium, their worldwide popularity is undisputed. They can be seasoned simply with salt or dressed up with spices, cheese, or sauces, and are often served alongside burgers, fried chicken, or sandwiches. The key to perfect fries lies in using the right potato variety and cooking them in a way that ensures both crispness and flavor.</p>
        <p>French fries’ charm lies in their simplicity and versatility. Whether thin and crunchy like shoestring fries or thick and hearty like steak fries, they adapt to many tastes and cuisines. They’re enjoyed with condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, vinegar, or specialty sauces, and in some countries, they’re even topped with gravy or melted cheese, as in poutine. From fast-food chains to gourmet restaurants, French fries remain a universal favorite, offering the comfort of something familiar yet endlessly customizable to suit any craving.</p>
